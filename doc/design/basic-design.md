# Basic design
This design document should answer these questions roughly

## WHAT?
_Describe and model the business workflow. Understand the product requirements and follow the money to find why theyâ€™re important from the business perspective._

## HOW?
_Think about the requirements and guarantees you need to have. Find architecture patterns and class of solutions that will fulfil your requirements. So, the type of databases, deployment type, integration patterns, not the specific technologies._

## WITH. 
_Select the tooling based on the outcome of the previous point. It has to fulfil requirements, but also non-functional like costs, match team experience, ease of use, etc._
